            <h1>About Find Your Anchor</h1>
            <p>Find Your Anchor is a web application designed to help college students find clubs and 
                activities that interest them. The application is designed to be used by students, school 
                administrators, and club leaders. Students can take an interactive quiz to find clubs that match their 
                interests, or they can browse clubs and activities by school. School administrators can add, edit, 
                and delete clubs and activities, and club leaders can add, edit, and delete their own clubs and 
                activities.</p>
